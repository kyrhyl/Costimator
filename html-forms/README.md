# DPWH Program of Works Form

This folder contains standalone HTML forms converted from DPWH reference PDFs. To use the form:

1. Open `dpwh-program-of-works.html` in any modern browser.
2. Fill the input fields and tables directly on the page.
3. Use the browser print dialog (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`) to print or save as PDF.

No build step or framework is required; the file is a single self-contained HTML page with inline styles.
